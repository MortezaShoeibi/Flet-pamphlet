# $Flet-pamphlet$

*I wanted to figure this framework out and I thought I can share what I learn about it with others.*

 *so what I'm going to do on this repo is to code and kind of create a **Flet** pamphlet or **Flet** cheat sheet.*

 
# $Comments$

*I'm planning to add long comments as notes between the codes to explain my thoughts and ideas, I'll do my best to keep it clean!*
