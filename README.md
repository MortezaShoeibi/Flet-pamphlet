# $Flet-pamphlet$

*I wanted to figure this framework out and I thought I can share what I learn about it with others.*

 *so what I'm going to do on this repo is to code and kind of create a **Flet** pamphlet or **Flet** cheat sheet.*

so Install Flet and let's get started:

```bash
pip install Flet
```
# $Comments$

*I'm planning to add long comments as notes between the codes to explain my thoughts and ideas, I'll do my best to keep it clean!*


# $Requirements.txt files$

*since I'm coding multiple programs I'm going to put each ones requirements.txt file in its own directory*


# $My.Website$
